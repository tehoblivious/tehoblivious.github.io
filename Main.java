//package io.github.jiangdequan; //automatically created, hmmph. 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         //so we just did an f1 command palette in vs code 
         //and it made a new java class file, NICE 
         //then typed in main or whatever and got a free main method to use 

         System.out.println("//then we type sysout and get this easily");
    }
}


//then CTRL-F11 in vs code will show java output really nicely ("run code", that extension I believe)
