# tehoblivious.github.io

- i am not a dog 
- i am a rabbit 
- test test 
- there should be a proper index.html now (although static)

TEST TEST LET'S TRY THIS IN VS CODE NOW... HMM. 

double lines to get a newline just like <br><br> would do (however, looks like this is true markdown, so it should work with HTML elements too :o hmmm -------> editediteditedit

doing git in vs code sure does make things more complicated, at least how vs code is treating me by using SSH also, 

- first of all, working working tree isn't correct, OOOOOH WAIT, I CAN FIX THAT, just change vs code workspace folder to the proper folder since it's tehoblivious.github.io\tehoblivious.github.io to work properly, so doing ls lists tehoblivious.github.io only instead of the actual files, soooooo ***FIXED*** CORRECT, that DID fix it.
